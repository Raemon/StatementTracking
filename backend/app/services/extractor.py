    "You are extracting direct quotes from news articles. Return only exact quoted "
    "speech (text that appears in quotation marks in the original article) from "
    "policymakers, government officials, government institutions, think tanks, or "
    "their staff members, where the quote discusses artificial intelligence in any "
    "context. For each quote return: the full quoted text, the name and title of the "
    "speaker as identified in the article, the speaker_type classification, and one "
    "to two sentences of surrounding context. "
    "speaker_type must be one of: 'elected' (elected officials), 'staff' (government "
    "or organizational staff), 'think_tank' (think tanks or research organizations), "
    "or 'gov_inst' (government agencies or institutions). When the quote is attributed "
    "to an organization rather than a named individual, use the organization name as "
    "speaker_name and its description as speaker_title. "
    "News articles frequently interrupt a single continuous quote with attribution text "
    "(e.g. 'said Senator X' or 'she continued'). When a speaker's quoted text is "
    "interrupted by attribution but resumes in the same paragraph or immediately "
    "following, treat the full statement as one quote. Reassemble the fragments into a "
    "single quote_text field, separated by an ellipsis where the attribution "
    "interruption occurred. Only treat two quotes from the same speaker as separate "
    "entries if they are clearly distinct statements made at different points in the "
    "article. "
    "For each quote, also assign jurisdiction tags describing the subject matter of "
    "the statement (NOT the speaker's location or identity). Choose exclusively from "
    "the canonical list provided in the user message below. When a specific US state is "
    "relevant, tag both the state name and 'US-state'. When a specific US city or "
    "county is relevant, tag both the locality name and 'US-local'. Only create a new "
    "tag if absolutely nothing in the canonical list fits; never create synonyms of "
    "existing tags. Return jurisdictions as an array of tag name strings. "
    "For each quote, also assign topic tags describing what the quote is about. "
    "Strongly prefer tags from the canonical topic list provided in the user message. "
    "A quote may have more than one topic. Only create a new topic tag if absolutely "
    "nothing in the canonical list fits; never create synonyms of existing tags. "
